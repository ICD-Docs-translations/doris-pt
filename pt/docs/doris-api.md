# Using DORIS from ICD-API

## For software developers and System Integrators:

It is possible to get access to the DORIS rule engine programmatically from the ICD-API. Currently, there is a prerelease of this system available.


- [ICD-API documentation](https://icd.who.int/docs/icd-api/APIDoc-Version2/) contains more information on the ICD-API

- [ICD-API Reference (Open API)](https://id.who.int/swagger/index.html) provides detailed explanations on the endpoints that the API supports including the `doris` endpoint
