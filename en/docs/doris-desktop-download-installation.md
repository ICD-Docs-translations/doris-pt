# Download and Installation

The DORIS Desktop software can be downloaded from the following link:

- Version 1.0 Release Candidate 1 
	- Download link for Windows: [DorisDesktop_1.0.0.0_x64.msix](https://icdcdn.who.int/doris/DorisDesktop_1.0.0.0_x64.msix)

DORIS installation and launch is a quick and very simple process and involves double-clicking on the downloaded file and following the on-screen instructions. 


**Troubleshooting:**

In rare situations, the installation of DorisDesktop may fail if the Windows component necessary for the tool is not installed on your computer and your corporate firewall blocks making the necessary update automatically during the Doris installation. In this case, you may need to install it manually. 

Download and install this only if your installation fails with a message about missing component
