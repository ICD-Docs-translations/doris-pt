# ICD-11 digital end-to-end solution for mortality reporting


![endtoendsolution picture ](img/endtoendsolution.png)

As part if ICD-11 end-to-end solution for mortality reporting, WHO developed a suite of digital tools for cause of death that consists of programs that assist in coding, selecting the single underlying cause of death and assessing the quality of the coding or the quality of the data. These digital tools are designed to enhance accuracy and efficiency in mortality reporting, ensuring standardized and reliable cause of death information.

## electronic Medical Certificate of Cause of Death (eMCCD)

The medical certificate of cause of death is the basis for collecting information on causes of death. The form is designed to collect all relevant aspects to assigning the cause of death and is independent of the revision of ICD. In addition to the paper form template in section 3.14, the technical specifications for a digital form are made available. The specifications serve to standardize input in line with the standard form and include a data dictionary for field names and content-encoding that allows processing the content with the API for coding, as well as with software for selection of the single underlying cause of death.


## ICD-11 Browser and coding tool

ICD-11 offers in various languages a browser known as the "blue browser" for ICD-11 and a smart coding tool. They can be accessed from ICD-11 homepage and enable users to search for diagnoses, index terms, concepts, anatomy, synonyms, or any other elements within the content of ICD-11.

## WHO Digital Open Rule Integrated cause of death Selection DORIS tool

DORIS tool is designed to assist in the automated selection of the underlying cause of death. This tool can be utilized both online and offline, accommodating free text and ICD-11 coded datasets. To enable processing by the software, the ICD mortality rules outlined in section  2.21 were transformed into a digital format, resulting in the ICD-11 digital mortality rulebase. For assistance in using the tool, please send an email to icd@who.int.

## Analysing Mortality and Causes of Death 3 (ANACOD-3)
This software performs a comprehensive and systematic analysis of mortality and cause-of-death data. ANACoD3 analyzes sub-national level data to inform of potential health equity issues or outbreak patterns; it also analyzes data over multiple time periods for trend analyses and allows for the analysis of cause-of-death data coded in ICD-10 as well as ICD-11 formats. It is available in multiple languages. For assistance in using the tool, please send an email to mortality@who.int.
